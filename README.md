# Deviot
Sublime Text plugin for IoT development using [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) ecosystem and supporting **~200** boards!

The integration with PlatformIO is not 100% ready, but will be in the near future. 
If you want to help me, please feel free to do it at any way you can.

## Setup

* [Install PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/#!/get-started)
* Add a new repository to Sublime Text `https://github.com/gepd/Deviot.git`
* Install the package `Deviot` from the list
* If you see `Install platformIO` in the main menu, go to `Set environment PATH` and paste the path where python/platformIO was installed

## How to use
1. Code your firmware
2. From the **Deviot** menu select one or more boards, an environment to work and a COM port
3. Build your code
4. Upload your code
5. Done!

## To Do
- [ ] Add Serial Monitor
- [ ] Languages
- [ ] PlatformIO API Libraries integration
- [ ] OTA Serial ports

**This plugin is under development, don't use in a production environment.**
